    In this homework, I try to describe a one-bit comparator in VHDL.
    I use both of \lstinline[language=VHDL]|xor| and with-select notation to represent a comparator. 
    The delay of the one with with-select notation is short than ones which is using \lstinline[language=VHDL]|xor|. When the frequency of the input signals  are higher then 50MHz,
    the delay of the one, which is using \lstinline[language=VHDL]|xor|, can not be ignored,
    and it has effects on other signals. However, The one with with-select notation is well.
